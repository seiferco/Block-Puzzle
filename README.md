# Number of Ways to Place Blocks
This project implements two recursive functions that compute the number of ways to place blocks, either using a simple recursion or a memoized approach. The problem involves determining how many ways you can place blocks on a grid given certain constraints (e.g., a 1x1 or 2x1 block).

## Problem Description
Given an integer n, the task is to determine how many ways blocks can be placed in a grid of size n using the following constraints:

- Blocks can be placed either as single 1x1 blocks or as 2x1 blocks.
- The function should return the number of distinct ways to fill the grid.

#### Example:
For a grid of size n = 4, the number of ways to place the blocks would be 5.
